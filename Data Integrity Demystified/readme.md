# Data Integrity Demystified

Session Abstract:
When we talk about “knowing our data,” we don’t seem to refer to the term “data integrity” anymore as part of that conversation. After all, that phrase can be very intimidating. But at its heart, it’s very simple – guaranteeing our data has meaning. The good news is much of what we already do creates data integrity in our databases. 

In this session, we will explore how the basic constructs in our database design enforce data integrity. We will look at this from table design down through details, like data types and constraints. Additionally, we will discuss the difference between objects that support data integrity and those that support database performance.

At the end of the session, you will have a better understanding of what data integrity is, how to implement and enforce it in your databases, and why it is so important for our data.
