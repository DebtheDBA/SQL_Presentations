Single Statement, Many Changes: How One Statement Can Modify Multiple Tables

You can only insert, update, or delete from one table at a time. At least that’s what they tell us when we first learn to write SQL statements. However, that one statement could modify multiple tables, and we may or may not even realize it is happening.

In this session, we will examine how a single data manipulation (DML) statement could change data for many tables. We will approach these from two different angles: implicit database design & explicit SQL code and objects. Syntax, performance gains, and gotchas of these different methodologies will be discussed. Finally, we will explore often overlooked changes that occur further downstream as a result of our DML statement.

When you leave, you will understand and appreciate how a DML statement against one table affects not only that table but how it can have a ripple effect of changes throughout your entire database.
