Welcome to my Superheroes test database!
-----------------------------------------

These backups will be used for the following sessions:

* Single Statement, Many Changes
* A Practical Starter Guide to SQL Notebooks
* Data Integrity Demystified

All backups are for SQL Server 2019.

If you are setting up for "Single Statement, Many Changes", you will also need to run the extra scripts after restoring the database to set up the initial replication. You can find those in the Scripts directory; those files start with Repl* 

If you are looking for the raw files, you can find them in the Scripts directory. Because the database is built based on the demos from other sessions, you can use the raw scripts but you will also need to run the demos for each one to make sure your database is in order. This is why restoring the backup is recommended.
